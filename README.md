# some-little-configs

This is my repository to hold config files. `copy_script.sh` copies all of the scripts and pushes any changes to git. It is scheduled to run every night at 3 am.

Here's where to back them up when I forget

| File  | Location |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| bash_aliases | ~/.bash_alisaes  |
| vimrc  | ~/.vimrc  |
| crontab | crontab -e |
